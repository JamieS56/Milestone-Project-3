## Testing
### Testing sidenav
The sidenav that is used so mobile users can access the menu wasn't working. This was because jquery wasn't connected so addded it to the base html and works now.

## Deployment
### Notes 
For the first couple of weeks of my project i din't realise I was pushong straight to heroku and not to github, which i realised when the gitpod workspaces went down and i lost the work on the workspace and it wasnt on github but was on heroku. so i cloned the heroku repository into a new workspace for my project using 'heroku git:clone -a APP-NAME' and reinstalled the packages that i needed and remade my env file.
